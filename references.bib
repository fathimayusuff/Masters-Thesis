State-of-the-art methods rely on hand-crafted templates with limited coverage. This paper presents QUINT, a system that automatically learns utterance-query templates solely from user questions paired with their answers. Additionally, QUINT is able to harness language compositionality for answering complex questions without having any templates for the entire question. Experiments with different benchmarks demonstrate the high quality of QUINT.},

% abstract = { The problem of natural language processing over structured data has become a growing research field, both within the relational database and the Semantic Web community, with significant efforts involved in question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA). However, many of these approaches are either specifically targeted at open-domain question answering using DBpedia, or require large training datasets to translate a natural language question to SPARQL in order to query the knowledge graph. Hence, these approaches often cannot be applied directly to complex scientific datasets where no prior training data is available. In this paper, we focus on the challenges of natural language processing over knowledge graphs of scientific datasets. In particular, we introduce Bio-SODA, a natural language processing engine that does not require training data in the form of question-answer pairs for generating SPARQL queries. Bio-SODA uses a generic graph-based approach for translating user questions to a ranked list of SPARQL candidate queries. Furthermore, Bio-SODA uses a novel ranking algorithm that includes node centrality as a measure of relevance for selecting the best SPARQL candidate query. Our experiments with real-world datasets across several scientific domains, including the official bioinformatics Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) challenge, as well as the CORDIS dataset of European projects, show that Bio-SODA outperforms publicly available KGQA systems by an F1-score of least 20% and by an even higher factor on more complex bioinformatics datasets. },

% abstract="Many question answering systems over knowledge graphs rely on entity and relation linking components in order to connect the natural language input to the underlying knowledge graph. Traditionally, entity linking and relation linking have been performed either as dependent sequential tasks or as independent parallel tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework called EARL, which performs entity linking and relation linking as a joint task. EARL implements two different solution strategies for which we provide a comparative analysis in this paper: The first strategy is a formalisation of the joint entity and relation linking tasks as an instance of the Generalised Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP). In order to be computationally feasible, we employ approximate GTSP solvers. The second strategy uses machine learning in order to exploit the connection density between nodes in the knowledge graph. It relies on three base features and re-ranking steps in order to predict entities and relations. We compare the strategies and evaluate them on a dataset with 5000 questions. Both strategies significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art approaches for entity and relation linking.",
