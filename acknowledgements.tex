I would first like to extend my gratitude and appreciation to my 
thesis supervisor, Professor Ahmed El-Roby, for his encouragement and relentless support. Thank you for your patience, guidance and valuable feedback throughout the thesis. I am both honoured and fortunate to have been one of your students. 

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my parents and my sister for supporting me in all my pursuits and inspiring me to follow my dreams. I would also like to thank my friends for always being there for me with encouraging words and high spirits.
